This page should serve as a review of the nessecary Electrodynamics, while also deriving theese volumetric formulations nessecary for Magnetohydrodynamics. 2.1 Lorentz Force A charged particle with a velocity \\(v\\) and charge \\(q\\) experiences the force given by \\[f = q \\vec{E_s} + q \\vec{E_i} + q (\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{b})\\] * \\(\\vec{E_s}\\) = Static Electric Field * \\(\\vec{E_i}\\) = Force from Varying Magnetic Field * \\(q(v\\times B)\\) = Lorentz Force The static electric field is Irrotational and has a fixed divergence. \\[\\nabla \\times \\vec{E_s} = 0 \\:\\:\\:\\: \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E_s} = \\frac{\\rho_e}{\\epsilon _ 0}\\] * \\(\\rho_e\\) = Total Charge Density * \\(\\epsilon_0\\) = Permitivity of Free Space The Electrostatic Potential \\(V\\) is given by \\[\\vec{E_s} = - \\nabla V \\:\\:\\: \\nabla ^2 V = \\frac{\\rho_e}{\\epsilon _ 0}\\] The total electric field given by \\(\\vec{E_s} + \\vec{E_i} = \\vec{E}\\) is subject to the following constraints. \\[\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho_e}{\\epsilon _ 0} \\:\\:\\: \\text{Gauss Law}\\\\ \\nabla \\times \\vec E = \\frac {\\partial \\vec B}{\\partial t} \\:\\:\\: \\:\\:\\text{Faraday&#39;s Law}\\] THe magnetic field \\(\\vec B\\) is a pseudovector, which will have consequences for Dynamo Theory. 2.1.1 Volumetric Lorentz Force Let \\(\\vec J\\) represent current density. \\[\\vec J = \\sigma \\vec E\\] In a moving frame, the same equation can be written as \\[ \\vec J= \\sigma (\\vec E + \\vec v \\times \\vec B)\\] We can identify this as the Volumetric Gauss Law The Electrostatic Lorentz force is given by \\(\\vec F = q (\\vec E + \\vec v \\times B)\\) Dividing this by the volume, we get \\[\\vec f = \\rho_l \\vec E + \\vec J \\times B\\] This is the volumetric Lorentz Force Equation. Claim: In non Relativistic Frames, the leading \\(\\rho_l \\vec E\\) term is negligible. Proof: We can write the continuity equation of charge to be of the form \\[\\nabla \\cdot \\vec J = - \\frac{\\partial \\rho _l}{\\partial t}\\] This simply says that the rate at which charge is decreasing inside a small volume must equal the rate at which charge flows out across the surface of that volume. Taking divergence on both sides of the volumetric gauss law, and substituting it in the continuity of charge equation, we get \\[\\frac{\\partial \\rho _l}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\rho _l}{\\tau _ l} + \\sigma \\nabla \\cdot (\\vec v \\times \\vec B) = 0\\] where \\(\\tau_l\\) represents the relaxation time of the system and is a very small quantity. So when we observe at timescales much larger than \\(\\tau _l\\), \\[\\frac{\\partial \\rho_l}{\\partial t} &lt;&lt; \\frac{\\rho _l}{\\tau _ l} \\] and we can neglect the term \\(\\frac{\\partial \\rho_l}{\\partial t}\\).Rearranging the terms we get that \\(\\rho_l = - \\epsilon _ 0 \\tau _l \\nabla \\cdot ((\\vec v \\times \\vec B)\\) is very small and can be neglected as well (because \\(\\tau _l\\) is small) Going back to the volumetric Lorentz Force equation, we find under these assumptions of Non-Relativistic frames, the equation reduces to \\[\\vec f = \\vec J \\times \\vec B\\] 2.2 Ampere Maxwell’s Laws The Ampere Maxwell Law is given by \\[\\nabla \\times \\vec B = \\mu \\left[ \\vec J + \\epsilon _ 0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec E}{\\partial t} \\right]\\] In conductors, this second term \\(\\epsilon _ 0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec E}{\\partial t}\\) contributes negligibly, and Maxwell’s Correction is not nessecary, leaving us with \\(\\nabla \\times B = \\mu \\vec J\\) Inverting the last equation there gives us the biot savart law. \\[B(x) = \\frac {\\mu}{4 \\pi} \\int \\frac{J(x&#39;) \\times \\vec r}{r^3} d^3 x&#39; \\] 2.3 Reduced Maxwell’s Laws We try to write the Maxwell’s laws in a form friendly to Magnetohydrodynamics. The general form of Maxwell’s Laws are given by the following: \\[ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec E = \\frac {\\rho _l}{\\epsilon _ 0}\\] \\[ \\nabla \\times \\vec E = \\frac {- \\partial \\vec B}{\\partial t}\\] \\[ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec B = 0\\] \\[ \\nabla \\times \\vec B = \\mu \\left( \\vec J + \\epsilon _ 0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec E}{\\partial t} \\right)\\] In addition to the Maxwell’s Relations the followign relations as well: \\[\\nabla \\cdot \\vec J = - \\frac {\\partial \\rho _ l}{\\partial t} \\\\ \\vec F = q (\\vec E + \\vec v \\times \\vec B)\\] For MHD, $_ l $ is negligible and the displacement currents are negligible, which gives us the following relations which are applicable in case of MHD. \\[\\nabla \\times \\vec B =\\mu \\vec J \\\\ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec J = 0 \\\\ \\nabla \\times \\vec E = - \\frac{\\partial \\vec B}{\\partial t} \\\\ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec B = 0 \\\\ \\vec J= \\sigma (\\vec E + \\vec v \\times \\vec B) \\\\ \\vec F = \\vec J \\times \\vec B\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
