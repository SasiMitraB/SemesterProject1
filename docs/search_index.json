Originating from integral geometry, these functionals measure geometric properties of sets and can describe the morphology of complex structures. In cosmology, Minkowski Functionals are particularly valuable for studying the large-scale structure of the universe, such as the distribution of galaxies and the cosmic web. They help quantify properties like the number, size, and connectivity of cosmic structures, providing insights into the underlying physical processes and the validity of cosmological models. In the study of the interstellar medium (ISM), Minkowski Functionals are employed to identify and characterize filamentary structures. These filaments, which are crucial for understanding the formation of stars and galaxies, can be challenging to detect due to their intricate and often diffuse nature. By applying Minkowski Functionals to observational data, researchers can effectively quantify the shape and distribution of these filaments, helping to elucidate their role in the ISM and improve our understanding of cosmic structure formation. My primary references that I used when learning were the following: 1. Minkowski Functionals in Cosmology, Schmalzing et al. [1], 2. Wikipedia page for Minkowski Functionals, [2] 3.2 A few basic defintions Functional: A Function mapping from a Space \\(X\\) to either Real or Complex Numbers. An example would be Linear Forms, ie, a mapping of a Vector Space to it’s scalar field. Hausdorff metric: It quantifies how far apart the sets are by considering the worst-case scenario of points in each set relative to the other. The Hausdorff metric is defined for two non-empty subsets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of a metric space \\((X, d)\\). It is given by: \\[ d_H(A, B) = \\max \\left\\{ \\sup_{a \\in A} \\inf_{b \\in B} d(a, b), \\sup_{b \\in B} \\inf_{a \\in A} d(a, b) \\right\\}. \\] Manifold: A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space. More precisely, each point on a manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic (i.e., topologically equivalent) to an open subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) 3.3 Bertrand’s Paradox: The Bertrand paradox is a problem within the classical interpretation of probability theory. Joseph Bertrand introduced it in his work Calcul des probabilités (1889) as an example to show that the principle of indifference may not produce definite, well-defined results for probabilities if it is applied uncritically when the domain of possibilities is infinite. In an attempt to solve this problem, Henri Poincare suggested to overcome such ambiguities by tying probability measures to geometric groups. This was later developed systematically by Minkowski, which later evolved into the field of Integral Geometry, or Geometric Probability Theory. Reference for this section: Wikipedia: Bertrand Paradox (Probability) wiki:Bertrand_paradox_?(probability) 3.3.1 Problem Statement The Bertrand paradox is generally presented as follows: Consider an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. Suppose a chord of the circle is chosen at random. What is the probability that the chord is longer than a side of the triangle? Classically, There are many ways to construct the sample space for this probability question, but we’ll be looking at two of them. 3.3.2 Method 1 Choose any point on the circle. A chord going through this point can have an angle between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\) radians with the tangent. Without Loss of generality, let one of the vertices of the inscribed equilateral triangle be at this point. The sides of the equilateral triangle coming from this point are forming angles of \\(\\pi / 3\\) and \\(2\\pi / 3\\) respectively. For the chord to be longer than the sides of the triangle, it must be a part of the range between the two sides of the triangle, and thus giving a probability of \\(\\frac 1 3\\) Figure 3.1: Illustration showing the sample space construction for method 1 3.3.3 Method 2 This method requires 2 observations: 1. The radius of the circle bisects any chord. 2. The radius is bisected by the side of the equilateral triangle. Figure 3.2: Illustration showing the sample space construction for method 2 Randomly construct a chord, and the chord could have a perpendicular distance to the center of either greater than $ r 2$ or less than \\(\\frac r 2\\), thus giving you a probility of the chord being longer than the side of the triangle as \\(\\frac 1 2\\). 3.4 A Diatribe on Topolgy and Functional Analysis I don’t know how to title this section. Just throwing a few A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space. More precisely, each point on a manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic (i.e., topologically equivalent) to an open subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Manifolds can be equipped with additional structures, such as smoothness or differentiability, which make them important in many areas of mathematics and physics. A group of transformation \\(G\\) acting on a manifold \\(M\\) is a group where each element of \\(G\\) corresponds to a transformation of the manifold. In other words, each element of \\(G\\) is associated with a function that maps points on \\(M\\) to other points on \\(M\\). The group \\(G\\) acts on the manifold \\(M\\) if there is a map: \\[ \\phi: G \\times M \\to M \\] such that for each \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(x \\in M\\), \\(\\phi(g, x)\\) gives a new point on \\(M\\). This map satisfies: 1. Identity: The identity element \\(e\\) of \\(G\\) acts as the identity transformation on \\(M\\), meaning \\(\\phi(e, x) = x\\) for all \\(x \\in M\\). 2. Compatibility: For all \\(g, h \\in G\\) and \\(x \\in M\\), \\(\\phi(g \\cdot h, x) = \\phi(g, \\phi(h, x))\\), where \\(\\cdot\\) denotes the group operation. A compact convex set is a fundamental concept in convex geometry and functional analysis. Here’s a detailed explanation: 3.4.1 Convex Set A set \\(C\\) in a vector space is called convex if, for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(C\\), the line segment joining \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is also contained in \\(C\\). More formally, \\(C\\) is convex if, for every \\(x, y \\in C\\) and for every \\(\\lambda\\) in the interval \\([0,1]\\), the point \\(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda) y\\) is in \\(C\\). 3.4.2 Compact Set A set \\(K\\) in a topological space (like a Euclidean space) is called compact if every open cover of \\(K\\) has a finite subcover. In simpler terms, \\(K\\) is compact if it is closed (contains all its limit points) and bounded (fits within some finite region). In Euclidean spaces, compactness is often characterized by these two conditions: a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. 3.4.3 Compact Convex Set Combining these two ideas: A compact convex set is a set that is both convex and compact. Convexity ensures that any line segment between two points in the set remains within the set. Compactness ensures that the set is bounded and closed, so it does not stretch out infinitely and contains all its boundary points. Examples of Compact Convex Sets Closed Interval in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\): The set \\([a, b]\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers with \\(a \\leq b\\) is a compact convex set in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). It is convex because any point between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is also between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and it is compact because it is closed and bounded. Closed Disk in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\): The set \\(\\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\leq r^2\\}\\) for some radius \\(r &gt; 0\\) is a compact convex set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). It is convex because any line segment between two points within the disk remains inside the disk, and it is compact because it is bounded and closed. Compact Convex Sets in Higher Dimensions: In higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), compact convex sets are similarly characterized. For example, a closed polytope (like a closed cube or tetrahedron) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a compact convex set. 3.5 Hadwiger’s Theorem In integral geometry, Hadwiger’s theorem characterizes the valuations on convex bodies on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\).
