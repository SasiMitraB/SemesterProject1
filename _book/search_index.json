Let \\(\\vec J\\) represent current density. \\[\\vec J = \\sigma \\vec E\\] In a moving frame, the same equation can be written as \\[ \\vec J= \\sigma (\\vec E + \\vec v \\times \\vec B)\\] We can identify this as the Volumetric Gauss Law The Electrostatic Lorentz force is given by \\(\\vec F = q (\\vec E + \\vec v \\times B)\\) Dividing this by the volume, we get \\[\\vec f = \\rho_l \\vec E + \\vec J \\times B\\] This is the volumetric Lorentz Force Equation. Claim: In non Relativistic Frames, the leading \\(\\rho_l \\vec E\\) term is negligible. Proof: We can write the continuity equation of charge to be of the form \\[\\nabla \\cdot \\vec J = - \\frac{\\partial \\rho _l}{\\partial t}\\] This simply says that the rate at which charge is decreasing inside a small volume must equal the rate at which charge flows out across the surface of that volume. Taking divergence on both sides of the volumetric gauss law, and substituting it in the continuity of charge equation, we get \\[\\frac{\\partial \\rho _l}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\rho _l}{\\tau _ l} + \\sigma \\nabla \\cdot (\\vec v \\times \\vec B) = 0\\] where \\(\\tau_l\\) represents the relaxation time of the system and is a very small quantity. So when we observe at timescales much larger than \\(\\tau _l\\), \\[\\frac{\\partial \\rho_l}{\\partial t} &lt;&lt; \\frac{\\rho _l}{\\tau _ l} \\] and we can neglect the term \\(\\frac{\\partial \\rho_l}{\\partial t}\\).Rearranging the terms we get that \\(\\rho_l = - \\epsilon _ 0 \\tau _l \\nabla \\cdot ((\\vec v \\times \\vec B)\\) is very small and can be neglected as well (because \\(\\tau _l\\) is small) Going back to the volumetric Lorentz Force equation, we find under these assumptions of Non-Relativistic frames, the equation reduces to \\[\\vec f = \\vec J \\times \\vec B\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
